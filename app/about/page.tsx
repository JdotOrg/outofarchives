            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Out of Archives began as a passion project between friends who shared a love for digital culture,
              minimalist design, and sustainable fashion. What started in a small apartment in Dubai has grown into a
              brand that celebrates the intersection of digital aesthetics and everyday wear.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              Our name reflects our mission: to bring digital artifacts and aesthetics out of the archives and into the
              physical world, creating wearable pieces that tell a story.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              We believe that clothing is more than just fabricâ€”it's a medium for expression and identity. Each piece in
              our collection is designed with intention, balancing aesthetic appeal with functionality and comfort.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Our designs draw inspiration from digital culture, minimalist art, and the evolving relationship between
              technology and humanity. We aim to create pieces that feel both timeless and contemporary.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              Sustainability is at the core of our practice. We use ethically sourced materials and work with
              manufacturers who share our values of fair labor and environmental responsibility.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Our unique mascots are the heart of our brand identity. Each character represents different aspects of
              digital culture and brings personality to our collections.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              From Pixel Panda to Byte Bear, our mascots are designed to be both playful and meaningful, creating a
              connection between the digital world and physical fashion.
